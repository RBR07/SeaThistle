                <p>Sea Thistle has been regularly raced at Poole Yacht Club since Autumn 2022. From September to December it is the Sunday Winter Cruiser racing series, taking a break over the colder winter months to start again in March for the Sunday Spring Cruiser racing series. As the days get longer the Tuesday Summer Cruiser racing series begins.</p>
                <p>After joining PYRA, the crew took on the challenge of a passage from the comfort of Poole Harbour along the South Coast to Weymouth where they spent the night to rest for their journey back home the next day.</p>
                <p>In 2024, the helm was keen to tackle the challenge of Round the Island (the Isle of Wight) which he had done before but never in his own boat. The boat was sailed over by 3 with the company of other PYRA boats to Cowes. Here it met the rest of their crew before starting the race the next day. Stormy weather with high winds and huge swell caused the crew to make the decison of turning back just over an hour into what would have been a 8hour long race. At least they will know what challenges they will face next year!</p>
